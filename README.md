# 🚴‍♂️ London Bike Ride 
This project visualises London Bike Ride data to uncover usage trends and seasonal behaviors. 

## 📊 Data collection
London Bike Sharing dataset sourced from Kaggle
🔗 [Kaggle Dataset – London Bike Sharing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)

## ⚙️ Process
1. Explored and inspected the dataset to understand structure, completeness, and key variables.
2. Cleaned and standardised the data by unifying column types, names, and value formats.
3. Exported the processed dataset to Excel for visualisation using Tableau.
4. Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing:
   - **Total bike rides in London** over a selected time period
   - **Moving average** of rides by weather conditions and hour of the day
   - A **heat map** visualising the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and moving average ride volume

## 💡 Insights

📊 **Ride Volume:** The daily moving average of bike rides showed significant variation, peaking at 30,000 rides per day between 09/07/2025 and 10/07/2025. This spike was not considered an outlier, as it aligned with favorable weather conditions. That summer season also exhibited greater variability in ride volume compared to other seasons, potentially due to fluctuations in temperature and the occurrence of heatwaves.

🌍 **Seasonal Trends:** Bike usage increases during the warmer summer month, from June to August, while fewer rides occur in winter, particularly in December and January.

🌤️ **Weather Impact:** The highest ride volume was observed when temperatures were around 14°C and wind speeds around 10 km/h. Overall, people were most comfortable riding in temperatures between 15°C and 25°C, with wind speeds ranging from 3.6 km/h to 25 km/h. This range likely reflects optimal riding conditions that balance comfort, safety, and physical exertion, making sharing rides more appealing to a broader group of riders.
